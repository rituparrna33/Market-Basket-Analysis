#Steps Performed

Data Preprocessing

Filtered data for specific country or period

Removed missing or invalid entries

Converted data to one-hot encoding (transaction Ã— item matrix)

Frequent Itemset Mining

Used the Apriori algorithm to find frequently purchased itemsets

Configured minimum support to identify meaningful combinations

Association Rule Mining

Generated rules using confidence, lift, and other metrics

Filtered rules to remove irrelevant items (e.g., POSTAGE)

#Insights & Analysis

Identified strong product-to-product associations
